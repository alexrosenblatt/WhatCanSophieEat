Milestone 0: 

Enter a food and a quantity and get a breakdown of fructose, sucrose, and glucose
- Sucrose is added into fructose and glucose as total sugars
- Page contains a brief description of Sophie's fructose limitations.
- If Sophie can eat the single item, then it returns: yes. If no, then it returns the quantity of the item that she can eat. It should make sense (e.g. not a slice of pizza).
- If an item returns no details for type of sugars, assume that it's fructose (and indicate to user that there is some uncertainty.)
- If user enters empty query or API responds, ask user to enter correct text. 

- If query is in DB then return db results, otherwise query api.


Milestone 1:
 enter a list of foods seperated by new lines and recieve an aggregated quantity of sugars.
- It should indicate how much of the food Sophie can eat.

Milestone 2
- There should be an about page with a more detailed description of FI.
